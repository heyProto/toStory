    "summary": " It's a carnage for the ages. The Wanderers, in the pink of its glory refuses to disappoint. Thank the rain, thank the lightning, thank Duckworth-Lewis, thank Chahal and his foot, thank the sloppy fielding, but South Africa have finally found a way to reverse the trend, to reverse the slide. No, don't get fooled by Phehlukwayo's 23 off 5, the game was in their bag much before. Perhaps even during the first lightning break that sucked away all of India's batting momentum. And then when it looked like Miller was getting schooled while batting, Chahal's no ball was just the diploma he needed to pass out. And how."
